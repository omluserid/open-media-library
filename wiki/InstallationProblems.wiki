= Resolving Installation Problems: =

*The installer says "The wizard has detected a previous installation of OML.  Press next to begin checking the database" when trying to install*
Look for a file called "settings.xml" under "C:\ProgramData\OpenMediaLibrary\" and rename it to 'settings.bak'. Try to reinstall.

*The SQL installer fails without giving a clue as to why*
SQL puts a log folder under "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Setup Bootstrap\Log" for every installation attempt and a "Summary.txt" log file for the last attempt. If the 'Summary.txt' does not suggest the problem find the latest folder by sorting on Date Modified. Inside that folder will be many 'Detail...txt' files which hopefully suggest in more detail the cause of the problem.
