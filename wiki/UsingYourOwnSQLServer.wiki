#summary Using your own installation of SQL Server.

= Introduction =

In many cases it is possible to use an existing installation of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Service Pack 1 as the backend database of OML. There are a number of steps to be performed in order to set this up summarised below. This is aimed at advanced user so it doesn't go into the detail required for a novice user.

Steps
1. Create the OML database.

2. Create an OML Login in the database.

3. Create a user mapping in the Login 'OML' to the 'OML' with a user 'OML'.

4. Assign the 'db_owner' role to this user/database.

5. Create the database schema.

6. Configure OML to use this database.
