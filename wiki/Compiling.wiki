= Introduction =

A lot of people want to try out OML, but a public release isn't available yet so here you have the instructions on how to compile it yourself.


= Details =

1) Compile the project (using any version of Visual Studio 2008 with [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=A43EA0B7-B85F-4612-AA08-3BF128C5873E&displaylang=en Media Center SDK 5.3]).

2) using a visual studio cmd prompt go into the Library\Setup (or Setup64) dir and run Build.bat

Note: This will require wix 3.0 (wix.sourceforge.net) to be installed.

3) run the installer

4) copy the OMLEngine\OML.config file to \program files\openmedialibrary and edit to your needs

5) run the OMLImporter.exe located in OMLImporter\bin\(debug or release)\ and follow its direction.  It will ask which importer to use (mymovies, dvd profiler and/or movie collectorz).  An open file dialog will appear, select your xml file.  This will take a moment to import your titles into oml.

At this point you should be good to go.  If your not seeing what something similar to what I posted the please post the files located in \program files\openmedialibrary\logs and your \program files\openmedialibrary\oml.dat file on our forums and we'll take a look at whats going on.  (Note, it wont be a high priority, but we'll get to it). 

NOTE:  The Movie Collectorz and the DVD Profiler plugins will not currently produce anything that can "play" movies since either of these apps contain location information for media.  If you want a decent exp. for now I'd stick with the mymovies export file.
