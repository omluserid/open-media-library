#summary Compiling the OML source is easy
#labels compile,source

= Introduction =

A lot of people want to try out OML, but a public release isn't available yet so here you have the instructions on how to compile it yourself.

For a reference how to use the SVN look here:

= Details =

Requirements
  * Visual Studio 2008 (the free version [http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/ Visual C# 2008 Express Edition] will also work)
  * NUNIT (http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=download)
  * WIX 3.0 (wix.sourceforge.net)
  * Media Center SDK 5.3 (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=A43EA0B7-B85F-4612-AA08-3BF128C5873E&displaylang=en)
  * Dxperience (http://www.devexpress.com/go/DevExpressDownload_DXperience.aspx)
    * Go to this page, http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Free/WebRegistration/ to sign up and get the tools needed for free. This is not a must, but else you will get a popup.

1) Compile the project using Visual Studio 2008 . Build -> Rebuild Solution

Note: This has to be done on a pc with Vista Media Center and the Media Center SDK 5.3 installed.

2) using a cmd prompt go into the Library\Setup (or Setup64) dir and run Build.bat

Note: This will require wix 3.0 to be installed.

3) run the installer located in the Library/bin/Release folder.

4) copy the OMLEngine\OML.config file to \program files\openmedialibrary and edit to your needs

5) run the OMLImporter.exe located in OMLImporter\bin\(debug or release)\ and follow its direction.  It will ask which importer to use (mymovies, dvd profiler and/or movie collectorz).  An open file dialog will appear, select your xml file.  This will take a moment to import your titles into oml.

At this point you should be good to go.  If your not seeing what something similar to what I posted the please post the files located in \program files\openmedialibrary\logs and your \program files\openmedialibrary\oml.dat file on our forums and we'll take a look at whats going on.  (Note, it wont be a high priority, but we'll get to it). 

= Troubleshooting =

*Q:* I get the following error compiling: Error 10 The command ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\..\..\..\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin\GacUtil.exe" /i "C:\OML\OMLEngine\bin\Release\OMLEngine.dll" /f" exited with code 3. OMLEngine

*A:* First try to run Visual Studio as an administrator. If that doesn't help, try to go to \program files\microsoft SDKs\Windows\ if the only folder there is 6.0A then open a command prompt and go to \program files\microsoft sdk\windows and input: mklink v6.0 v6.0a. Try compiling again, should help. 

NOTE:  DVD Profiler plugin will not currently produce anything that can "play" movies.  If you want to play movies for now I'd stick with the mymovies export file or movie collectorz untill DVD Profiler is fixed. The Movie Collectorz imported was tested with version 5.5 build 2.
