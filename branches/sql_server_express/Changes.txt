Changes in version 1.0.1 (2008-08-08)

- Relax MCEPRODUCTVERSION checks in WiX to allow installs on systems with the TV Pack RTM installed
- MountImagePlayer modified to return a DVDPlayer instead of passing the stream back through the Factory
- Append instead of truncate the logfile when restarting
- Updated DVRMSPlugin to force use of full paths for both files and cover art
- Fixed bug in Setup UI where selecting add all titles actually skipped all titles
- Change settings screen to use pivots. Added pivots for View Settings and Daemon Tools

- Play a sound when selecting items on the screen
- JIL uses the sortname instead of name
- Added new settings tab, Customize UI

- added option to
	 - Don't Resize Cover Art (may slow down brosing) - should bring the quality way up for people with faster machines
	               default is still to resize - personally I select don't resize and I have no problem with performance
	 - Cover Art Rows (1 to 10)
	 - Cover Art Spacing (0 to 20, incremented by 2 as to not create a big list)	 

- Cover art size and scaling up when focused are based on a simple formula now, we'll see how it goes.

- Setup UI screens now refer to plugins by their description rather then by name
- You can now turn on/off the Black Overlay bar from the settings screen
- Patch provided by user "fonager" to fix paths in Title objects

- added ability to NOT use thumbnails but instead use "sized" full-def images from settings screen'
- Patch provided by user "MostlyHarmless" to the DVD Library XML importer
- Disabled the setup UI screen(s) until further testing and bug fixes can be completed... they will be back
- Added support for WTV files (new dvr-ms files with TV Pack 2008 aka Fiji)
- Initial support for plugins of different types (metadata, import, etc)
- Updated importing of oml.xml files
